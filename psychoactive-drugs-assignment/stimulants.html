            <h3 style="text-align: center;">That's right, not all drugs are illegal. For example, nicotine is a highly addictive chemical found in cigarettes and many vapes. It is commonly derived from tobacco plants and can be very harmful to your health</h3>

                <div class="physiological">
                    <h4>Physiological Effects</h4>
                    <p>Nicotine can cause a loss of appetite, increased heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, diarrhea, and nausea. Additionally, long-term use can damage arteries, the lungs (especially if it's inhaled), the skin, and the brain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="psychological">
                    <h4>Psychological Effects</h4>
                    <p>Nicotine can improve one's mood as well as improve memory and alertness. That being said, it also has been linked to a higher risk of major psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.</p>

                <h4>Overdose and Withdrawal</h4>
                <p>Nicotine overdose is very rare, and oftentimes does not occur with regular use. The most common overdose occurs when someone injests a large amount of vape liquid, which has a high concentration of nicotine in it. Nicotine overdose can cause fainting, difficulty breathing, headache, irregular heart rate, vomiting, and weakness</p>
                <p>Nicotine withdrawal is common because the acute effects of nicotine wear off after a few minutes. There are a miryad of physiological and psychological symptoms, but the more common ones are dry mouth, insomnia, irritability, cough, and cravings.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Effects on Neurotransmission</h4>
                <p>Nicotine is an <b>agonist</b>, which not only stimulates the brain to produce more dopamine but also increases its overall effect in the brain.</p>
                <p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that's specifically linked to improved mood and the brain's reward systems. It's good to have dopamine, but too much can cause addiction, something that is extremely common with nicotine.</p>
