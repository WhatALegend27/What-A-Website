            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Although it is still federally illegal in the United States, many states have either decriminalized or legalized this drug for personal and medicinal use. Marijuana itself isn't what causes a high, but THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), a chemical found in cannabis, does.</h3>

                    <h4>Physiological Effects</h4>
                    <p>Marijuana has few physiological effects, as it mainly impacts the central nervous system. However, it can cause impaired motor function when taken in higher amounts, as well as dizziness and nausea. It also increases appetite.</p>

                    <h4>Psychological Effects</h4>
                    <p>Marijuana can alter one's senses as well as their sense of time. It can also cause changes in mood and difficulty thinking. At high doses, it can cause hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis.</p>

                <h4>Overdose and Withdrawal</h4>
                <p>Marijuana overdose has never been reported, but high doses of THC have been known to cause uncomfortable symptoms. It can cause paranoia and anxiety, as well as a major psychotic episode.</p>
                <p>Marijuana withdrawal is fairly mild and short lived, and is mostly limited to grouchiness, sleepiness, a decreased appetite, anxiety, and cravings.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Effects on Neurotransmission</h4>
                <p>THC is an <b>agonist</b> that stimulate the cannibanoid receptors in the brain that are critical for learning and memory.</p>
                <p>THC can cause developmental issues relating to these receptors when used regularly by children. Some studies have shown an IQ decrease of up to 8 points in adolescents.</p>
